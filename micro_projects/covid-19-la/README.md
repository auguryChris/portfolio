Authored by: Aditya & Chris

## Step 1: Pull ATTOM Data
https://github.com/adityahpatel/SIADS691-Covid-Real-Estate/blob/main/00.API_CA.ipynb
https://github.com/adityahpatel/SIADS691-Covid-Real-Estate/blob/main/00.API_NY.ipynb
These two notebooks pull real estate transaction in each of the 74 California counties and 90 New York Counties.
#### Maximum API results returned per query is limited to 10,000 
Using custom function salesdata_scraper_bycounty() used on https://api.gateway.attomdata.com/propertyapi/v1.0.0/sale/snapshot to query:
1) FROM DATE - 1st January 2019
2) TO DATE - 1st April 2021
3) Minimum transaction size - $200K
4) Maximum transaction size - $50M
5) County_geoid

Each of these generated a JSON file, which is saved in: (https://github.com/adityahpatel/SIADS691-Covid-Real-Estate/tree/main/datasets) 

The incremental time slicing method left us with 322 files for California, 166 New York files and over 1.5 million transaction records with 43 features for transactions between January 1, 2019 to March 4, 2021
